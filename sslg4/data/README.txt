The subdirectories under this directory contain all the energy-dependent properties of the scintillators included in SSLG4. There is a directory for each scintillator, and each scintillator's data is collected within its respective directory. Under each scintillator directory, there are as many txt files as there are properties defined for that scintillator. These files store energy-dependent properties in two columns, listing energy-value or wavelength-value pairs.
