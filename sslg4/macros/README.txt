The subdirectories under this directory contains macro files (files with a .mac extension) containing user interface commands for users. These files also store energy-independent properties of the scintillators. There is a macro file corresponding to each scintillator in SSLG4. These files enable users to add, remove, or modify properties of scintillators at runtime of their applications.
